            <h2>How Do We Do That?</h2>
            <p>At Homeroom Heroes, we facilitate a streamlined process for teachers to create profiles and curate wishlists of essential classroom supplies sourced from Amazon. Our platform empowers community members to directly support teachers by selecting items from their wishlists and having them shipped directly to their classrooms.

Together, we make a meaningful impact on education, one classroom at a time.</p>

                <h3>Justin Brundage</h3>
                <p>Founder & CEO</p>
                <p>I'm Justin Brundage, founder and CEO of Homeroom Heroes. My journey began in August 2023, inspired by a local radio station's effort to support teachers by fulfilling their classroom wish lists. Witnessing the financial burden teachers face—spending an average of $850 of their own money on supplies in 2023—galvanized me to create Homeroom Heroes.</p>
                <p>Growing up in a close-knit community, I experienced firsthand the profound impact teachers have on shaping lives. Recognizing their invaluable contributions, I embarked on a mission to give back. Armed with a degree in Material Science and Engineering from Washington State University, I founded Homeroom Heroes to revolutionize support for educators. Our platform connects teachers directly with the resources they need, empowering communities to rally behind their local heroes and ensure every classroom has the tools to inspire future generations.</p>
                <p>Join me in honoring the dedication of our teachers and making a lasting impact on education.</p>
